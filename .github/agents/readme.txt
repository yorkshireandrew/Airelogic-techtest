Agents do not trigger automatically. They can only be invoked by the front-matter of a prompt file in the prompts folder.
If several prompt files require the same persona, rules and decision making it is better to put that context in an agent file and invoke it.

Agent files define:
an agent persona
its behavioral rules
its decision-making style
